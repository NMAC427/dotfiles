# `Dotfiles`

## Work in progress...

### Quick Setup

- Clone this repository.
- Review [install.conf.yaml](../install.conf.yaml)
- Run [./install](../install) to automatically set up the development environment.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/NMAC427/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles; ./install
```

> Note that the install script is idempotent: it can safely be run multiple times.

## Making Local Customizations

You can make local customizations for some programs by editing these files:

* `git` : `~/.gitconfig_local`
